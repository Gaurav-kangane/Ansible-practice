What Ansible is
    Ansible is an automation tool used to manage servers and applications. You use it to configure systems, install software, deploy apps, and run repetitive tasks across many machines from one control node.

It is:
    Agentless. No software needed on target servers
    
    Push based. Runs tasks over SSH
    
    Simple. Uses YAML, not complex scripts


How Ansible works
    Control Node: The machine where Ansible is installed (your EC2, laptop, or CI server)
    
    Managed Nodes: Servers Ansible connects to using SSH
    
    Inventory: List of servers Ansible manages
    
    Playbook: YAML file that defines what tasks to run
    
    Module: Small unit of work like install a package, start a service
