1. Create two servers (EC2) without key pair one is control node where we are running ansible server and second is worker node that is our target server.

2. Connect Ansible server --> sudo su - --> install ansible --> dnf install ansible -y

3. Create ssh key for connecting target servers
   ssh-keygen    --> press enter till key creates.

4. Copy the public key and add to target server cd .ssh -->  cat id_rsa.pub --> copy the key.

5. Connect the target server in different tab and go to .ssh --> cd .ssh --> patste the key in --> vi authorized_keys

6. Go to ansible server and connecect through ssh -->  ssh <private-ip-of-target-server> -->    e.g.  ssh 172.31.1.227 

7. You will successfully connected to target server then press exit 

8. vi /etc/ansible/hosts  --> enter the private ip of target server and save and exit

9. Then run command --> ansible all -a "yum install git -y" -b

10. Go to target server and check git version, git will be installed in target server

11. ansible all -a "yum install maven -y" -b

12. Check in target server mvn -version

13. Go to instances console and create AMI from target server and to to AMI option and create ec2 instance from AMI.

14. Give target-2 name to new server and connect it

15. Go to Ansible server and add private ip of target-2 server --> vi /etc/ansible/hosts
    e.g 172.31.1.227
        172.31.11.121

16. Then run -->  ansible all -a "yum install tree -y" -b

17. check in target-2 server --> tree   --> tree will be installed

18. we can also add the ip in the group --> vi /etc/ansible/hosts  e.g  [test]
                                                                        172.31.1.227
                                                                        [dev]
                                                                        172.31.11.121

19. run --> ansible test -a "yum install docker -y" -b

20. Go to test group server i.e target-1 and check --> docker version --> also chcek in target-2

21. We can also add ip in another file --> vi inventory --> add the private ip

22. Run this command for configuration --> ansible -i inventory all -a "yum install python -y" -b
