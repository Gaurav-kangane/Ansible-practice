What is Ansible inventory
    An inventory is the list of hosts Ansible manages, grouped in a logical way.
    
    Ansible uses inventory to answer three questions:
    
    Which servers exist?
    
    How are they grouped?
    
    How do I connect to them?
    
    Without inventory, Ansible only knows about localhost.
