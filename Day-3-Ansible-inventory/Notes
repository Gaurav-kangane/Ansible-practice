What is Ansible inventory
    An inventory is the list of hosts Ansible manages, grouped in a logical way.
    
    Ansible uses inventory to answer three questions:
    
    Which servers exist?
    
    How are they grouped?
    
    How do I connect to them?
    
    Without inventory, Ansible only knows about localhost.

What “include” means in Ansible
    “Include” lets you split automation into smaller files and reuse them.
    Instead of one huge playbook, you break logic into tasks, roles, or vars and include them when needed.
    
    This improves:
    
    Readability
    
    Reusability
    
    Conditional execution

What is an Ansible role
    A role is a standard way to organize automation.
    
    Instead of writing everything in one playbook, you group:
    
    tasks
    
    variables
    
    handlers
    
    templates
    
    files
    
    into a reusable structure.
    
    Think of a role as a self-contained module for a purpose like installing Apache, configuring users, or setting up Docker.


Why roles are used
    Roles help you:
    
    reuse automation across projects
    
    keep playbooks small and readable
    
    separate logic from configuration
    
    follow best practices (team friendly)
